            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m all about taking complex stuff and making it simple, clear, and—most importantly—worth your time.
                With a solid 20 years of experience in technical writing, project management, and straight-up good
                communication,
                I’m here to make sure every project I touch runs smoothly and looks sharp.
                Whether it's editing a 500-page dossier or coordinating a full-blown renovation project,
                I’ve got the skills and the attention to detail to pull it off.
                But I’m not just about business—connecting with people is my game too.
                When I’m not wordsmithing or juggling projects, I’m diving deep into genealogy, using my Ancestry.com
                wizardry
                working to discover my roots.
                I’ve also spent time overseas, collaborating with communities to help families facing serious
                challenges.
                So, if you need someone who can handle the details and cares about the big picture, you’ve come to the
                right place.
